This particular phone type exposes its power data through a JSON file.
The file is located on the phone's storage at /home/status.json

To calculate the remaining charge of the phone use the following equation:
charge = ((currentAmperage * 4.5 + 1500) / currentHz) * 100

For example:
- Charge is 75% when Amperage is 1 and HZ is 2000
- Charge is 76% when Amperage is 5 and HZ is 2000

To display the charge on the screen you must call the telephone ChargeDisplay class using the displayCharge(newValue) method.
