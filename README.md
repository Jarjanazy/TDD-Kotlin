# TDD-Kotlin

In this exercise we are going to solve the same problem twice. The first time not using a TDD approach
,and the second time using TDD. The goal is to see how different the design will look in the two approaches.

## Problem Definition
We are going to design a solution to display the phone's charge indicator. 
This will be done in three steps:
- Reading data from the Phone's battery interface.
- Calculating the remaining charge percentage.
- Displaying the info on the screen.

## Solution Criteria
We want the code to be well tested and to fulfill clean coding standards:
- Modularity.
- Cohesiveness.
- Separation of concerns.
- Abstraction.
- Loose coupling.
